      This is the classic game of noughts &amp; crosses, with a difference.
      The aim is to specify a width/height of a grid of boxes, and then take turns choosing a box, with the goal of selecting a certain number in a row. This number can be chosen on setup.
    </div>
    <div class="info">
    For example, common noughts and crosses has a "Grid Width/Height" of 3, and a "Win Threshold" of 3 as well, meaning a player must select three boxes in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, in order to win.
      In Noughts &amp; Mines, you can change the grid and the goal, to make it more challenging!
