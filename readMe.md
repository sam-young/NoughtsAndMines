Tic Tac Toe - Read Me

This project is a new interpretation of the popular game.

### Goals & Starting Philosophies

My key goals are to build a user experience that is seamless, and makes sense from start to finish.

I started development by building a wireframe map of the core html page with divs, with the intention that each stage of the game would stay true to this format (three horizontally opposed sections with internal elements, with a 1:2 height to width aspect ratio, positioned centrally on the page).

The welcome page of the app was planned to have a title for the game in the first section, a welcome message or description in the second, and something for the user to interact with in the third, such as a play button to start the game going.

### Phase One

#### Steps

I planned phase one to be building the basic flow of the game including the following steps:

- User clicks play
- User enters player one name and then continue
- User enters player two name and then continue
- The game board is built, and the user is given a message to indicate which player is to go first
- Each player then takes turns selecting a square until a winner is found or draw
- The user either opts to play again, or return home
- A count is kept of the winners & draws until the user returns home when it is reset
